# event-planner
I plan on creating an application that allows people to plan events. 
This app will have features that allows people to name their events, adjust the expected number of people, target audience, set the date and time of their events, location, privacy, and describe their events. 
Event creators will have access to their events and the list of people attending as well as any co-hosts, as well as checking the qualifications of their attendees. 
Event attendees will ask to join events, see any events they are attending, their date and time, and location. 
Everyone will be able to see any events that's happening near or around them and the number of people who are registered for that event.
